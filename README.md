# TICTACTOE
  This application allows the user to play a game of tic tac toe.  This is a project for the software engineering immersive 08 at General Assembly.  I walso wanted to do this project because it seemed fun and I wanted to approach this from a mathematical point.

## Planning story
    During the planning phase of the project, I had planned on writing the bulk of my program first. This step would be primarily done during or after the first day.  After writing a vague outline of my code, I wouldthen start to dynamically fix bugs that exist from this vague outline of my code.  My second day would be primarily dedicated to solving and fixing these bugs.  The third day would then be used to set up the api and allow for communication between the api and the local machine.  The fourth and final day would be dedicated to refining and preparing the final code for deployment as well as documentation of code.  During the development process of this project, I had hit many different problems with the api, primarily the specific format of data that the api wanted.  During this problem, I first turned to my colleagues in order to listen to their advice as well as garner any kind of help that I could possibly receive.  After this event, the problem with the data format would be solved by reformatting the data sent to the api as well as calling different functions used to populate that data.
